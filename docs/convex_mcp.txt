Deployment Tools

    status: Queries available deployments and returns a deployment selector that can be used with other tools. This is typically the first tool you'll use to find your Convex deployment.

Table Tools

    tables: Lists all tables in a deployment along with their:
        Declared schemas (if present)
        Inferred schemas (automatically tracked by Convex)
        Table names and metadata

    data: Allows pagination through documents in a specified table.

    runOneoffQuery: Enables writing and executing sandboxed JavaScript queries against your deployment's data. These queries are read-only and cannot modify the database.

Function Tools

    functionSpec: Provides metadata about all deployed functions, including:
        Function types
        Visibility settings
        Interface specifications

    run: Executes deployed Convex functions with provided arguments.

    logs: Fetches a chunk of recent function execution log entries, similar to bunx convex logs but as structured objects.

    envGet: Retrieves the value of a specific environment variable
    envSet: Sets a new environment variable or updates an existing one
